# Bitrot Fixer

If you have a file (jpeg, mp3, etc) which has become corrupted by [bit rot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_rot), and
you know what the correct checksum should be, this CLI project will try and flip every bit in the file until it finds
the one that is incorrect.

Runs the checksum operations across all available cores for speed improvements

### Args:<br>

Mandatory: file to check<br>
Mandatory: correct checksum<br>
Optional: 1 or 2 flipped bits to try<br>

### Usage

```bash
./mvnw clean package
java -jar target/bitrot-fixer-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar src/test/resources/test-image-two-flips.jpeg md5:8a673261e62cdfc9072b0dc3ee4d21eb 2
```

#### Native
To build a native Linux image, download the [Graal](https://www.graalvm.org/) JDK
```bash
JAVA_HOME=/path/to/graaljdk ./mvnw -DskipTests -Pnative clean package
target/bitrot-fixer src/test/resources/test-image-two-flips.jpeg md5:8a673261e62cdfc9072b0dc3ee4d21eb 2
```

#### Currently supported checksum algorithms:

* crc32
* crc32c
* md5
* sha1
* sha256
* sha384
* sha512
* sha3_256

#### Current limitations

* Trying two bit-flips takes a very long time on large files, due to all the possible combinations (<filesize>Â²)
